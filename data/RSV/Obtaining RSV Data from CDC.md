The primary RSV ground truth data we use in our forecasting/early warning efforts is the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP)'s [Respiratory Virus Response Emergency Department Visit Trajectories by State and Sub State Regions Combined Dataset.](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2023-respiratory-virus-response-nssp-emergency-department-visit-trajectories-by-state-and-)

## Data Features

This dataset is updated once per week on Friday and is uploaded with a one-week lag (for example, data uploaded on 27 June 2024 will have data up to 20 June 2024). 

Per the CDC's [Companion Guide for NSSP ED Data on Respiratory Illness](https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/php/onboarding-resources/companion-guide-ed-data-respiratory-illness.html), this data is limited in the following ways:

- State-level data for Missouri is not shown because the proportion of records with a discharge diagnosis is low.
- State-level data for New Hampshire, South Dakota, and Washington are not shown due to data usage agreements that take precedence over public data release.
- Data for Guam is not shown due to small counts.

The percent of visits is calculated as the percent of all emergency department visits by age group.
